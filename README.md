[01 overview](./course/01-overview/README.md)

A first course in abstract data structures and algorithmic design making use of these structures. Topics include asymptotic analysis, trees, dictionaries, heaps, disjoint set structures; divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming algorithms. Special emphasis will be placed on the implementations of these structures and their performance tradeoffs. Both asymptotic complexity analysis and experimental profiling techniques will be introduced. Labs will be used to provide students with hands-on experience in the implementations of various abstract data types and to perform experimental performance analysis.

Textbook (required):

Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, Fourth Edition, by Mark Allen Weiss, Pearson- Education, 2014.

 

Major Course Materials:

The primary course website is Canvas. You are responsible for all information we post on Canvas, including any possible changes to assignments after they are assigned.

 

Labs and Exams:

Labs will be announced every Monday and due on the Friday of the same week. For these labs, you will implement data structures using C++ under Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). Ubuntu 20.04 can be download freely online at https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ Links to an external site.. If you are using Windows or Mac machine, you can install a virtual machine to run Ubuntu. VirtualBox is freely available from https://www.virtualbox.org/ Links to an external site.. Lab submissions will also be through Canvas. No late submission will be accepted, unless in cases of uncontrollable emergency events. Questions dealing with labs and laboratory assignments must be directed to the GTAs. If you still have difficulty after talking with the GTA, see the instructor for help.

There will be one midterm exam and one final exam, both comprehensive. The dates for the exams will be announced at least two weeks ahead. Please reserve these dates on your calendar. The exams will be closed notes and closed book. No electronic is allowed during the exam except calculator. A make-up midterm or final exam will be given to any student who is absent from an exam for a compelling reason and gets permission from the instructor. Unless otherwise stated, all material from lectures and laboratories, homework assignments, the underlying concepts, and information posted on Canvas are fair game for exams.
