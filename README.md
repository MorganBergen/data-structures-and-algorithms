# data structures and algorithms

A first course in abstract data structures and algorithmic design making use of these structures. Topics include asymptotic analysis, trees, dictionaries, heaps, disjoint set structures; divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming algorithms. Special emphasis will be placed on the implementations of these structures and their performance tradeoffs. Both asymptotic complexity analysis and experimental profiling techniques will be introduced. Labs will be used to provide students with hands-on experience in the implementations of various abstract data types and to perform experimental performance analysis.
