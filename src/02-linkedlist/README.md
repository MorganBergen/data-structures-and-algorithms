[testing](#testing)## objective -  get familiar with doubly linked list basic operations and their implementations using c++11-  get familiar with iterators-  get familiar with c++ inheritance and overloading## specification of the adt-  implement the basic linked list methods as summarized in the template file1.  rename the object name to `MyLinkedList`2.  implement `operator-- ()` and `operator-- (int)` for both of the `const_iterator` and `iterator` classes3.  implement a `void reverseList(void)` method for the `MyLinkedList` object which reverse the current list4.  implement a `MyLinkedList<DataType>& appendList (MyLinkedList<DataType&& rlist)` method for the `MyLinkedList` class, which accepts as parameter another `MyLinkedList` class and appends all its items to the end of the current linked list.5.  implement a `bool swapAdjElement(iterator &itr)` method, which swaps the element pointed by `itr` with its next element.  if the swap is success, return `TRUE` otherwise (e.g. the next element $DNE$) and return `FALSE`## testingcompiled under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `g++` version 9.3.0 (default) with C++11 standard.
