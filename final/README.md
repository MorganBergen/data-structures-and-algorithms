####  1.  describe two essential requirements for hash function design

the main objectives of desiging a has function is to evenly distribute the records and easy to compute (associate with a smaller constant even in O(1) time)

<p>
a hash function is a mathmematical function that takes an input (such as a string or number) and produces a fixed-size output (usually a number).  the purpose of a hash function is to map the input data to a unique output value, which can then be used as an index for storing or retrieving data in a hash table.  when desiging a hash function, the two essential requirements must be considered

1.  **even distribution of records**:  the has function should dsitribute the input data evenly across the available has table slots.  which means that each possible output value should have an equal chance of being assigned to any given input value.  if the hash function is not evenly distributed, it can lead to a collisions which is where two different input values are assigned to the same output value.  collisions can cause performance issues and data loss.

2.  **easy to compute**: the hash function should be easy to compute, meaning that it should be associated with a smaller constant even in O(1) time.  this means that the time it take to compute the hash function should be constant, regardless of the size of the input data.  if the hash function is too complex or time-consuming to compute, it can slow down the performance of the hash table.

####  2. recall avl tree what is the avl property and draw the resulted avl tree after inserting 10 into the following avl tree.

</summary>
the main goal of avl trees is to maintain a balanced structure, ensuring that search, insertion, and deletion operations have logarithmic time complexity.

the avl property states that for each node in the tree, the height difference between its left and right subtrees must not exceed 1.  this property ensures that the tree remains balanced, preventing it from degenerating into a linear structure like a linked list, whcih would lead to much slower search times.  here is more details to the answer,

1.  the height of a node:  the height of a node is the length of the longest path from node to a leaf (aka a node without children).  the height of an empty tree is typically considered to be -1.

2.  balancing factor:  the balancing factor of a node is the difference between the height of its lef subtree and the height of its right subtree.  the avl property requires that the balancing factor of every node in the tree must be -1, 0, or 1.

when an insertion or deletion operation causes the avl property to be violated, the tree must be rebalanced.  there are four possible cases of imbalance that can occur, and they can be resolved using rotation operations.

1.  **ll** left left case:  this occurs when a node is left heavy (i.e. its left subtree is taller than its right subtree), and its left child is also left heavy.  this can be resolved by performing a right rotation at the unbalanced node.

2.  **lr** left right case:  this occurs when a node is left heavy, and its child is right heavy.  this can be resolved by performing a left rotation at the left childm followed by a right rotation at the unbalanced node.

3.  **rr** right right case:  this occurs when a node is right heavy (i.e. its right subtree is taller than its left subtree), and its right child is also right heavy.  this can be resolved by performing a left rotation at the unbalanced node.

4.  **rl**  right left case:  this occurs when a node is right heavy and its right child is left heavy.  this can be resolved by programming a right rotation at the right child, followed by a left rotation at the unbalanced node.

these rotations ensure that the avl property is maintained after insertions and deletions, keeping the tree balanced and guaranteed $O(log n)$ time compleity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.


```markdown
      15
     /  \
    7   18
   / \
  3   8
```

in order to insert the value 10 into the avl tree we must follow the following step

1.  perform a binary search tree insertion:  traverse the tree from the root, following the left child if the new value is less than the current node and the right child if the value is greater than the current node.  repeat until an empty position is found for the new value

```markdown
      15
     /  \
    7   18
   / \
  3   8
       \
        10
```

2.  Check for the AVL property violations: Starting from the newly inserted node, move up the tree and check the balance factor of each node. If the balance factor is -1, 0, or 1, the tree is still balanced. If the balance factor is not within this range, we need to perform rotations to rebalance the tree. (In this case, the balance factor of node 8 is -1 (right subtree height 1, left subtree height 0). As we move up the tree, we find that the balance factor of node 7 is -2 (right subtree height 2, left subtree height 0), violating the AVL property.)

3.  Perform rotations to rebalance the tree: We have a left-right (LR) case since node 7 is left-heavy and its left child (node 8) is right-heavy. To resolve this, we perform a left rotation on node 7, followed by a right rotation on node 15.

**left rotation on node 7:**

```markdown
      15
     /  \
    8   18
   / \
  7   10
 /

```

**right rotation on node 15**

```markdown
      8
     / \
    7   15
   /   /  \
  3   10  18
```

the tree is now balanced and the avl property is maintained.

####  3.  give the pseudocode of the Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm for finding the shortest path from an edge- weighted graph that contains no negative edge. Let the source node be ùë†, and your algorithm should find the shortest path between ùë† and all other nodes in the graph.

<code>
void Graph::dijkstra(Vertex s) {
    for each Vertex v {
        v.dist = INFINITY;
        v.known = false;
    }
}

s.dist = 0;

while(there is an unknown distance vertex) {
    Vertex v = smallest unknwon distance vertex;
    v.known = true;

    for each Vertex w adjacent to v {
        if(!w.known) {
            DistType cvw = cost of edge from v to w;
            if(v.dist + cvw < w.dist) {
                // update w
                decrease(w.dist to v.dist + cvw);
                w.path = v;
            }
        }
    }
}
